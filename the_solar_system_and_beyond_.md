If you launch a satellite with a speed of 5 miles/s (8 km/s) , you should be able to put it in Low-Earth Orbit. If you launch it at 7 miles/s (11 km/s), the satellite will escape the Earth.

As humans, we are just starting space exploration. We have sent spacecrafts to all the planets in our solar system and Voyager 1 and 2 are now outside of our solar system, exploring the vast expenses between stars. You can go to the <a href="http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/where/" target="_blank">NASA website</a> to see in real time where Voyager 1 and 2 are. You can also see movies about their trip! 

>They were launched in the 70's and they are just now leaving the solar system.

## The Universe is Big. Really big 

The closest star from our beloved Sun is Alpha Centauri at 4.37 light-years away; see Fig. "Closest Stars". 

> A light-year is the distance light travels in a year. It is equal to $$9.46\times 10^12'; km$$. 

Alpha Centauri is in the constellation Centaurus and it is the third brightest star in the sky. Interestingly, Alpha Centauri is not a single star but rather a system of three stars orbiting each other. Proxima is the smallest of the three stars and it is very weakly associated with the other two. Technically, Proxima is really the closest star to us.

We live together with 100 billions of other stars in the Milky Way galaxy, a typical spiral galaxy. We also have now very good evidence that at the center of our galaxy, there is a supermassive black hole called **Sagittarius A\***; see Fig. "Milky Way".

And if we look beyond we see millions and millions of other galaxies. They tend to cluster into the aptly named: galaxy clusters. Galaxy clusters are the biggest objects held together by gravity that exist in the Universe. See the Coma Cluster in Fig. "The Coma Galaxy Cluster".

The vastness of the Universe is absolutely bewildering.

This is a very well made video by NASA of entry, descent and landing of the Mars Rover. In order to send a robot to Mars, it needs to escape the Earth and it therefore moves at least at 11 km/s. Slowing it down to land on Mars, where you want, is a challenging feat of engineering!
