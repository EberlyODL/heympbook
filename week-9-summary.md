- When a wave is confined or constrained, only a discrete set of vibration modes are allowed. These are called standing waves. For the case of a string of length L pinned at both ends, or a tube, the wavelengths are

$\lambda_n = \frac{2L}{n}$

for n = 1, 2, 3, . . . where n is the harmonic number.

- An electron has a wavefunction $\psi$ associated with it. The intensity of the wavefunction tells us where we have more chances of finding the electron.
- When the electron is confined, its wavefunction shows standing wave patterns and the wavelength of the electron wavefunction is quantized.
- This leads (via de Broglie's relationship) to a quantization of the momentum and the energy.
- For an electron in a box, the energy levels go like the harmonic number squared.
