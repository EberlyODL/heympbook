## Lesson Objectives

The objectives for this lesson are that by the end of the week you will be able to

* LOFor00: calculate the net forces from multiple forces in one dimension
* LOFor01: apply the idea that net forces are related to change in momentum.
* LOFor02: apply Newtonâ€™s third law in some examples.
* LOFor03: predict whether the electric force will be attractive or repulsive in various situations
* LOFor04: estimate the magnitude and direction of the electric force given the electric field 

1. 

Explain Newton's three laws of motion.
2. Calculate the average force felt in an interaction given the change in momentum and the time.
