## Lesson Objectives

The objectives for this lesson are that by the end of the week you will be able to

* LOFor00: calculate the net forces from multiple forces in one dimension
* LOFor01: apply the idea that net forces are related to change in momentum.
* LOFor02: apply Newtonâ€™s third law in some examples.
* LOFor03: predict whether the electric force will be attractive or repulsive in various situations
* LOFor04: estimate the magnitude and direction of the electric force given the electric field
