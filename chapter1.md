In the weekly lessons,  you will often see many discussions between Sophie and Marie. Sophie is a virtual student at Penn State and just like you she is super interested in learning physics and she is full of questions. Marie is a successful \(but still virtual :\) graduate student in physics who will try to answer all of Sophie's questions.
