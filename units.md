Now is a good time to pause and discuss units. Physical quantities are described by a number followed by a unit of measurement. In scientific discussion, you cannot just gives answer with numbers, you need to specify the unit.

If we ask you how much energy there is in your soda can and you answer 1... we then wait ... and follow by 1 what?

It could be 1 Joules, 1 Calorie or maybe 1 orange worth of energy? 1 is not an answer, you need a unit. 

Units are often abbreviated. So for example a second becomes s. 

> Usain Bolt ran the race in 9.69 s

We can also modify the units by adding a prefix. Here is a list of common prefixes that can be added to any units to decrease or increase its value by the corresponding factor (expressed in scientific notation)
 
| name | abbreviation | factor  
| --------------------
| pico | p | $10^{-12}$
| nano | n | $10^{-9}$
| micro | $\mu$ | $10^{-6}$
| milli | m | $10^{-3}$
| centi | c | $10^{-2}$
| kilo | k | $10^{3}$
| mega | M | $10^{6}$
| giga | G | $10^{12}$


> Usain Bolt run the 100 m race. This is the same as the 0.1 km (0.1 kilometer) race. 

### Different units for the same thing

Over time, physicist have invented many different units for the same physical quantities. 

The horsepower is the typical power (energy per time) of a working horse. The unit is abbreviated by hp. 

1 hp = 745 Watts

Other well known unit conversions between inch (in), miles (mi) and meters (m)

* 1 in = 2.54 cm
* 1 mi = 1609 km

All three units in, mi and m represents ** the same physical quantity of distance**. They are just different size of measurement. 

In science, most equations requires one to decide and use a single set of units. The standard currently
