Now is a good time to pause and discuss units. Physical quantities are described by a number followed by a unit of measurement. In scientific discussion, you cannot just gives answer with numbers, you need to specify the unit.

If we ask you how much energy there is in your soda can and you answer 1... we then follow by 1 what?

It could be 1 Joules, 1 Calorie or maybe 1 orange worth of energy???

Units are often abbreviated. So for example a second becomes s. 

> Usain Bolt ran the race in 9.69 s

Here is a list of common prefixes that can be added to any units to decrease or increase its value by the corresponding factor (expressed in scientific notation)
 
| name | abbreviation | factor |
| pico | p | $10^{-12} |
| nano | n | $10^{-9} |
| micro | $\mu$ | $10^{-6}$|
| milli | m | $10^{-3}$ | 
| centi | c | $10^{-2}$ |
| kilo | k | $10^3$ |
| mega | M | $10^6$ |
| giga | G | $10^9$ |

> Usain Bolt run the 100 m race. This is the same as the 0.1 km (0.1 kilometer) race. 

### Different units for the same thing
