In the current setup (see Fig Two beam). The outcome vs probability are

### Outcome for two beamsplitters

|outcome|P
|-------
|photon reaches D0|1
|photon reaches D1|0

Imagine we change the setting slightly by putting our hand in the lower beam between the two beamsplitters. Our hand will absorb the photon and let us say that we can tell "Ow!" 

 This will destroy the interference effect. We send the photon in the apparatus it has 50% chance of striking the hand. If it does, its done. If it does not that we know the photon is in the upper beam before the final beam splitter. The second beamsplitter will split halfway between up and down. So the end result
 
 ### Outcome for two beamsplitters and hand in lower beam

|outcome|P
|-------
|photon reaches D0|1/4
|photon reaches D1|1/4
|photon hits hand|1/2

> Note that the chance of detecting photon in detector D1 has increased by putting a hand and block part of the beam!!

This is another example of complementary. If we determine in which beam the photon was going, we destroy the interference pattern. The act of measuring changes the state. If the photon does not hit my hand, I will know that it is in the upper beam. I have acquired information which then affect further measurements. 

## Testing bombs. 

We can push this to the extreme. Imagine a factory that produces bomb that can be trigger by a single photon. Once in a while the factory produce bomb that are a dud. We would like to be able to know whether the bomb works or not. We could send a photon but then if the bomb works it will explode. We will know that it work but we will have lost the bomb!

Well you say, lets just put the bomb in the lower beam above. If the bomb is a dud, it should do nothing and we should detect the photon always in D0. If the bomb work, it will be like the hand and we will chance the probability. 

|Bomb is a dud||Bomb is working| |
|-------
|outcome|P|outcome|P
|photon reaches D0|1|photon reaches D0|1/4
|photon reaches D1|0|photon reaches D1|1/4
|bomb explodes|0|bomb explodes|1/2

Ok so we put a bomb to test, it explodes. You turn to your manager: "Sorry that one was working but it is loss now, I can test another, You put another, you detect a photon in D0. You say sorry, I cannot tell if its working or not, let us send another photon. The photon arrives in D1. You turn to your manager, this bomb is working!

Note that the photon never triggered the bomb but the fact that it could have has destroyed the interference effect and allowed it to go to D1.

If you are not seriously perplexed by this. Reread this page again. 

> If the photon lands in D0 a 100 times, the you can tell your manager. There is a very good chance that this bomb is a dud.
