Recap: We have a setup where the photon starts in lower beam. A beam splitter creates a state where the photon could be either up or down and a second beamsplitter repeats the splitting with a minus sign difference for the wave on the lower beam. The minus sign leads to destructive interference in lower beam and the final state is 100% certain to be in the upper beam. The setup is shown in Fig "Two beamsplitters...). Here is a table of outcome with probabilities

### Outcome for two beamsplitters

|outcome|P
|-------
|photon reaches D0|1
|photon reaches D1|0

Imagine we change the setting slightly by putting our hand in the lower beam between the two beamsplitters. Our hand will absorb the photon and let us say that we can tell when a photon hits. When a photon arrive, you scream "Ow!" 

 This will destroy the interference effect (the hand, not the screaming).  We send the photon in the apparatus it has 50% chance of striking the hand. If it does, its done, the photon was absorbed by the hand. If it does not  hit the hand than we know the photon is in the upper beam before the final beam splitter. The second beamsplitter will split halfway between up and down. So the end result is

### Outcome for two beamsplitters and hand in lower beam

|outcome|Probability (P)
|-------
|photon reaches D0|1/4
|photon reaches D1|1/4
|photon hits hand|1/2

> Note that the chance of detecting a photon in detector D1 has increased by putting a hand by blocking part of the beam!!

This is another example of complementary. If we determine in which beam the photon was going in the middle, we destroy the interference pattern. The act of measuring changes the state. If the photon does not hit my hand, I will know that it is in the upper beam. I have acquired information which then affect further measurements. 

## Testing bombs. 

We can push this to the extreme. Imagine a factory that produces bombs that can be triggered by a single photon. This is probably hard to do so once in a while the factory produces bombs that are dud (not working). We would like to be able to know whether a bomb works or not. We could just send a photon but then if the bomb works it will explode. We would know that it work but we would have lost the bomb!

As a quantum physicist, you have an idea. We will put the bomb in the middle lower beam of the setup above (between the beam splitter). If the bomb is a dud, it should do nothing and we should detect the photon always in D0. If the bomb works, it will act as a "hand detector" and it we will change the probabilities. 

|Bomb is a dud||Bomb is working| |
|-------
|outcome|P|outcome|P
|photon reaches D0|1|photon reaches D0|1/4
|photon reaches D1|0|photon reaches D1|1/4
|bomb explodes|0|bomb explodes|1/2

Ok so we put a bomb to the test, it explodes. You turn to your manager: "Sorry that one was working but it is loss now, I can test another."

You put another bomb, you detect a photon in D0. You say "Sorry, I cannot tell if its working or not, let us send another photon."
 
The next photon arrives in D1. You turn to your manager, this bomb is working!

### This is strange yes. 

Note that the photon never triggered the bomb but the fact that it could have done so was enough to destroy the interference effect and allowed the photon to go to D1. The photon was in a superposition of upper and lower beam and this superposed state knew about the bomb even though it never triggered it (it had 50% chance of doing so).

> If the photon lands in D0 a 100 times, you can tell your manager. There is a very good chance that this bomb is a dud.
