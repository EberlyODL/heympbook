## Silicon Valley vs Graphene Valley what will the future hold?

You may have heard the term Silicon Valley. It refers to the southern region of the San Francisco Bay area. This region hosts many of the world's biggest tech companies. Nowadays, these companies mostly work on software or internet services, but in its early days it used to be known for all the silicon chips innovators and manufacturers.

Silicon is element 14 on the periodic table of elements, and it is a semiconductor.


Graphene is a 2-dimensional (can be 1 atom thick!) Carbon structure (element 12). Carbon can form amazingly diverse variety of structures. Depending on the arrangement of the atoms some of the structures are insulators. Some of the structures (like the 2D graphene) are semiconductors. Current and future research like that in the News Flash are trying to tap into graphene for semiconductor technology because it can make very small transistors (even smaller than current technology).
