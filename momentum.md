Energy is not the only thing that is conserved in the world. There is another quantity that all particles have; it is called momentum. We use the letter $p$ to denote momentum. And just like energy, it is a law of physics that the **_total momentum of a system is conserved._** Before we look at that statement in more details you should first examine the picture of the swinging balls.

This is called "Newton's craddle." (And the reason why science teachers should never be put on playground duty...) Look closely at the collision. When a ball hits the stack, the ball at the other end picks up and continues the movement. It looks like something is transmitted. Well, there is something "transmitted" and it is not just energy. In this kind of collision, momentum is conserved and the ball at the other end has the same momentum as the ball that just hit had.

So what is momentum? Fundamentally, momentum and energy are very related. We talked previously about how energy is the ability to make things move. Well, momentum is the ability to change the movement, the ability to provide an impulse to other objects. The more momentum, the bigger the impulse you can provide. What is happening in Newton's craddle is that each time there is a collision, an impulse is given to the other balls.

There is simple formula for momentum. It is just

$p = mv$

just mass times velocity.

### Velocity

Great but what is velocity exactly. Velocity tells
