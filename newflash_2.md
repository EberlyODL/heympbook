### Kinetic Energy

The amount of energy in a moving object can be huge (e.g. meteors). Here is a simple equation that describes this   
  
 <lrn-math>K= \frac12 m v^2 </lrn-math>  
  
We will use the letter K to denote kinetic energy. If you put the mass of the object in kilograms, the velocity of the object in meters/second, then the energy in this equation will be in Joules. This simple equation will come back again and again in this class and you should know the following facts which follows from it:

1. If you double the mass of an object in movement, the kinetic energy will double. Massive objects that move can have _massive_ amount of energy.
2. If you double the speed of an object in movement, the kinetic energy quadruple (multiply by 4 because of the square). Even small objects can have huge amount of kinetic energy if they move really fast.

### Newsflash 2

Earth is hit by meteors from time to time. The last big hit was in February 15, 2013! How much energy did it have? Here is a link to a news article on the subject.

[Asteroid Hit in Russia](www.foxnews.com/science/2013/02/15/injuries-reported-after-meteorite-falls-in-russia-ural-mountains)

Some facts about the asteroid from the European Space Agency (ESA) can be found [here](www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Situational_Awareness/Russia_asteroid_impact_ESA_update_and_assessment).

Lets do the calculation ourselves below: 
Mass: 10,000 tons (9,000,000 kg!)
Velocity: about 40,000 mph ( approx 64,000 km/h) when it exploded.

How much kinetic energy did it have when it landed?
 <lrn-math>K = \frac12 mv^2 </lrn-math>
 <lrn-math>K= \frac12 (9,000,000 kg)(18,000 m/s)^2 </lrn-math>
 <lrn-math>K=1.4x10^15 J = 350 </lrn-math> billion Calories ( 4,000,000 kWh) 

Equal to ~500 kilotons of TNT!  

Where did that energy go when it crashed? This is a good question to think of as we move on...
