Now that we have some background both the flow of electrons (current) and how electrons get their energy (batteries or power plants on the grid) we will focus a bit on what happens in the home. First, it is important to define the relationship between current and voltage in a circuit, and this is known as **Ohm's Law**, because it was defined by one Mr. Georg Ohm. He said that the amount of current that you get in a circuit depends on the voltage supplied divided by the amount of **resistance** to current in that circuit. 

$I= V/R$    

Resistance (which is the $R$ in the equation above), is just that - something which slows down the current flow, usually by taking some of the electron's kinetic energy and turning it into something else.  (We will not use this equation for any calculations, only for our discussion about safety)


## Circuits 
Take the lightbulb for example. The electrons start out with some initial energy, which they lose they pass through your house and into different devices. Some of the kinetic energy the electrons has is converted to thermal energy (light bulbs are hot!) and, of course, some of it is converted to light. 

There are generally two ways to wire multiple devices to a power source: 
- You could string them along in a line: toaster, microwave, refrigerator, etc. This is called **series** wiring. The problem with this in your house is that each appliance has to share the same voltage, divided up between them. No problem if each appliance only needs 30V or less. If you look at each device though, they all say "120 V" - because that is how much they need to run (which is the voltage that comes out of the outlet). How do we assure each appliance gets 120 V?  We change the wiring. 

- Buildings are instead wired in **parallel**. In parallel each appliance gets is own connection to the voltage source (a.k.a. outlet), and they split up the current, allowing a smaller amount of current can go through each appliance at once.

Think of the queue's in a grocery store. There are many check-out counters that you can choose from - once you chose one then you purchase all your groceries at a single counter. This is parallel wiring in a store(!).

The series analogy would be to have 1 single line with multiple registers - you'd have to buy some groceries at each register as you go along the line. This is the same as with electrical current. 


## Electricity and you
<picture of breakers>
Sharing current is where circuit breakers come into play. Generally, homes are equipped with circuit breakers and fuses. Is there a physics reason for these? Not really. These are there to prevent large currents from entering your home because they are a fire hazard, and dangerous to us humans. If you plug in too many appliances, they all want their share of the current coming into the house. Too many appliances = too much current, so you can "trip a breaker". 


- S: So how much current is too much? 
- M: Good question. Your body can handle about 1 mA (0.001) Amps without a problem - it will give you a small shock, but about 0.1 A is fatal. Somewhere in between you can go into cardiac arrest because your heart works by electrical signals.

- S: but what about the tag on my hairdryer which says "Danger: Keep Away From Water" - I mean, I know that's a bad idea, but why?
- M: Well, when your skin is wet, it conducts electricity much easier, and its resistance decreases by about 100x,  which means even small amounts of current have potentially deadly outcomes. Tap water is also a rather good electrical conductor so even if the hairdryer is turned off, water could "short" the wiring and.. well, bad things can happen. 
- S: So, swimming pools and lightning?
- M: Yep, also bad, same reason.
