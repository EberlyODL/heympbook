Before we look into more details of the photoelectric effect, let us have a look at the main tool we will be using to analyze the behavior of the electron. This is the **potential energy graph**.

- S: Can you remind me again what is potential energy?
- M: Sure, there is a potential energy for each force. Right now, the only force you have studied is the electric force which, as you remember, is the charge q times the electric field (not energy) $F=qE$.
- S: Yes, I remember that.
- M: Ok, well another way to think about the force is in term of electric potential energy U. Think of the electric potential energy as being a roller-coaster or skate park like we saw in week 2. This potential energy is everywhere in space (just like the electric field) and you can find the force on a particle by simply looking at the **slope** of the potential. The steeper the slope, the stronger the electric force.

> If you are in area where the potential energy is varying quickly, you will find a big force in the direction of lower energy. If you are in area where the potential energy is constant, you will not feel any force.

## Total Energy

The total energy of an electron and proton under the effect of an electric force with electric potential energy is just potential + kinetic.

$E_{tot} = K+U$

### Turning Points

Turning points are simply points in space where the particle has no more kinetic energy and must either stop or turn back. To find turning points, you can just draw a horizontal line on the energy graph at the value of the total energy. The turning points are where the total energy is equal to the potential energy (see Fig "Turning Points")

> Turning points are places where the object must have a velocity of zero and thus stop momentarily. This occur when kinetic energy is zero which occurs when the total energy is all in the form of potential energy. 

Sometimes the particles could be in different regions of space and it may not have enough energy to access some other regions. They are trapped in one well and cannot escape to the nearby well. (see Fig. "Trapped Region").
