Last week, we discussed how light can be thought to be made of particles with energy

$E = hf$

where _h_ is known as Planck's constant. The frequency _f_ is the number of cycle per second that we would measure if we thought of light as a wave. Note how strange this is, a property of the wave, the frequency, determines the energy of the particle...

Planck's constant is a small number equal to $h = 6.63\times 10^{-34}\; J\; s$. The units of _h_ are Joules times second. The particles of light are called photons.

## The Photon

The photon is a fundamental particle just like the electron. As far as we know it has no substructure (it is not made of anything else). It is a fundamental particle of nature and it has the following properties:

[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2235|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left]

1. It has a mass of 0; i.e., it is massless.
2. It has an electric charge of 0; i.e., it is (electrically) neutral.

Remember the electron? The photon is similar yet different. To answer the next question you may want to review energy in special relativity (since the photon moves at the speed of light, relativity is necessary).

But light -as we have seen - is an electromagnetic wave. This was demonstrated in your first lab where you saw dark and bright fringes after light went through a double slit. These dark and bright fringes resulted from constructive and destructive interference which can only be explained using the principle of superposition

How can we reconcile the result of our first lab if light is a particle?
