We are wrapping up our quick tour of energy. Hopefully, the concept will become less and less weird as we return frequently to the subject. You should think of energy as something that every particle has and that is associated with its movement or can induce the particle to move.

** What makes energy so important in physical systems is that it is a conserved physical quantity. **

### The Conservation Principle

To talk about conservation of a physical quantity, we need to be careful to define a _system_. This is arbitrary, you always can choose what the system under consideration is. 

>An example of a system could be a car (but not the road). 

A quantity is conserved if it impossible to destroy or create it **from within the system**.

> The car contains gasoline which is burned in the engine. The conservation principle states that the energy was there from the beginning and the burning process just transforms the energy from chemical form in the gasoline to kinetic energy of the car. There is no energy coming out of nowhere.

It is always possible to transfer energy or momentum in or out of the system. This does not violate the conservation principle but if we do get transfer in or out, then the physical quantity will not be constant; it will change in time. If there is no transfer of energy in or out, then the energy within will be not only conserved but truly constant.

> A car breaks on a road and suddenly stops. While breaking it lost a lot of kinetic energy that went to warming up the road (thermal energy). If the road is not part of the system under consideration, then the car transfers out energy to the road. If the system under consideration is the car-road together, then there is no transfer out of system. The energy is constant.  We just have a transformation of energy into different forms. Kinetic energy of car went to thermal energy of road.

### Example of an almost conserved quantity: Money

Another good analogy is money. The money in your bank account is a conserved quantity. You cannot create it or destroy it. You can change its form from checking to saving, you can transfer out by buying stuff and you can transfer in by receiving your paycheck. The amount of money in your bank account is not constant, it changes with time. 

But, as far as you can tell, money is a conserved quantity. Of course, the federal government really can create money and so fundamentally this is not a conserved quantity.

The idea with energy (and momentum soon), is that there is no Universe government that can create or destroy energy, at least we have no evidence that this has ever occurred.
