Physics is about energy and motion. A lot of what makes physics hard in higher level classes is the fact that motion occurs in 3 dimension of space (up/down, left/right and forward/backward). 

Analyzing three dimensional motion (or 2 dimensional motion) can be technical but does not bring very many new concepts. 

** In this class**, we will almost always describe motion in one dimension. When we discuss motion in more than 1 dimension, it will alway be qualitative. 

So imagine we live in a Universe that is a single line. The online place you can go is right or left. 

[Fig line]

We can denote our position on this line using a label $x$. We can call our home the $x=0$ spot and everything to the right is positive $x$ values while everything to the left is negative $x$ value. ** To prevent confusions, we will always take $x$ to increase to the right.**

Lets look at the rocket motion we saw in the first "promo" video on this page. This is a motion on a line. The rocket started from rest and kept moving faster and faster each time. 

To represent this motion, first imagine that the rocket and me are represented by a single point (imagine that we have no size). We can then do a series of snapshot of where the rocket at equal interval of time. This may look like. 

This figure is very informative. It tell us the position of the rockets at different instant of time. Since the interval of time are equal we see that the rocket car traveled a bigger distance between time 4 and time 5 than it did between time 1 and time 2. The speed was greater toward the end than it was at the beginning. The rocket car was _accelerating_. 

## Graphs 
In science, we often like to use graphs to represent and visualize information. A graph is an abstract, conventional way of presenting something to an audience. A usual graph has two axis for example here is a positive versus time graph. 

** It is very important to carefully determine what the vertical and the horizontal axis mean when you first see a graph **

So, for example we could decide to do a position versus time graph for the rocket car. To do that we just puts points on the graph where vertical heights represent position and horizontal distance represents time. To help me do this correctly, I can just turn the previous image with the x axis horizontal and move that to being vertical. Then I separate each point at equal horizontal spacing to  This looks like
