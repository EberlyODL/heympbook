Physics is about energy and motion which is turns out to be the the basis for everything else. A lot of what makes physics hard at higher level is the fact that motion occurs in 3 dimension of space (up/down, left/right and forward/backward). 

Analyzing three dimensional motion (or 2 dimensional motion) can be technical. We will
