Physics is about energy and motion which turns out to be the basis for everything else. A lot of what makes physics hard at higher level is the fact that motion occurs in 3 dimension of space (up/down, left/right and forward/backward). 

Analyzing three dimensional motion (or 2 dimensional motion) can be technical but does not bring very many new concepts. 

** In this class**, we will almost always describe motion in one dimension. When we discuss motion in more than 1 dimension, it will alway be qualitative. 

So imagine we live in a Universe that is a single line. The online place you can go is right or left. 

[Fig line]

We can denote our position on this line using a label $x$. We can call our home the $x=0$ spot and everything to the right is positive x values while everything to the left is negative x value.

Lets look at the rocket motion we saw in the first "promo" video on this page. This is a motion on a line. The rocket started from rest and kept moving faster and faster each time.
