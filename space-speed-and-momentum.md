Physics is about energy and motion. A lot of what makes physics hard in higher level classes is the fact that motion occurs in 3 dimension of space (up/down, left/right and forward/backward). 

Analyzing three dimensional motion (or 2 dimensional motion) can be technical but does not bring very many new concepts. 

** In this class**, we will almost always describe motion in one dimension. When we discuss motion in more than 1 dimension, it will alway be qualitative. 

So imagine we live in a Universe that is a single line. The online place you can go is right or left. 

[Fig line]

We can denote our position on this line using a label $x$. We can call our home the $x=0$ spot and everything to the right is positive $x$ values while everything to the left is negative $x$ value. ** To prevent confusions, we will always take $x$ to increase to the right.**

Lets look at the rocket motion we saw in the first "promo" video on this page. This is a motion on a line. The rocket started from rest and kept moving faster and faster each time. 

To represent this motion, first imagine that the rocket and me are represented by a single point (imagine that we have no size). We can then do a series of snapshot of where the rocket at equal interval of time. This may look like. 


This figure is very informative. It tell us the position of the rockets at different instant of time.
