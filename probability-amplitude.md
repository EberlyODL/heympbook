The wave that is "linked" to the photon is the electromagnetic wave which is a fairly complicated object with oscillating electric and magnetic field. We can understand the concept of quantum mechanics by using a simplify picture for the wave. 

Denote the photon wave by $\phi(x)$ where represent the amplitude of the wave and x is the position on the screen. 

> a wave oscillates in space (with a certain wavelength) and it oscillates also in time (with a certain frequency). In practice, the oscillation in time are so fast that we always detect average quantity. Therefore, we will only keep track of variation in space. 

So for a single slit we would get that $\phi(x)$ is maximum
