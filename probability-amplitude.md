The wave that is "linked" to the photon is the electromagnetic wave which is a fairly complicated object with oscillating electric and magnetic fields. A full analysis is very technical. We can understand the concepts of quantum mechanics by using a simplify picture for the wave. 

Denote the photon wave by $\phi(x)$ where $\phi$ represents the amplitude of the wave and x is the position on the screen. The amplitude of the wave will vary for different position so we say $\phi$ is a function of $x$ or $\phi(x)$. Let us imagine that the wave oscillates between 1 and -1. 

> a wave oscillates in space (with a certain wavelength) and it oscillates also in time (with a certain frequency). In practice, the oscillation in time are so fast that we always detect average quantity. Therefore, we will only keep track of variation in space. 

Given our discussion from the last section, the probability of finding a photon at position x will be 

$P(x) = \phi(x)^2$. 

Because we need to square, we say that $\phi$ is the **probability amplitude **. This is a strange object, the square root of probability!

> Probabilities are just numbers with no units. The probability that a coin lands on head is 1/2. No units needed. The **probability amplitude** that a coin land on head is $1/\sqrt{2}$. This is also just a number with no units. Once you square it, it gives the probability of 1/2.

Here we have two waves (see fig below again). Note that the images show the intensity ($\phi(x)^2$) not the wave and more intense is more dark.

So let us denote the wave from slit 1 $\phi_1$ and the wave from slit 2 $\phi_2$. 

If only slit 1 is opened we get the pattern on uppermost left image. The probability is max at the center and goes to zero on either side. Same with slit 2. 

Now, if we open both slits, the wave that will reach the screen will be a superposition of wave 1 and wave 2. Superposition is the sum so 

$\phi(x) =\phi_1(x)+\phi_2(x)$

The probability of finding a photon at x is the square of $\phi$. 

$P(x) = (\phi_1+\phi_2)^2$.

## Classical Probability versus Quantum probability

We can now see the first really strange things about quantum mechanics. Let us say that a look at position $x$ where $\phi_1 = 1/\sqrt{4}$ and $\phi_2=-1\sqrt{4}$. 

If only slit 1 is opened. The probability of finding a photon at x would be 1/4. 

If only slit 2 is opened. The probability of finding a photon at x is also 1/4 (the minus sign does not matter when you squared. 

Normal thinking human would say that the probability that with both slit open, that the photon from slit 1 **OR** the photon from slit 2 land at x is 1/4+1/4 = 1/2 (the sum of the probability). 

But NO! The probablity is $P = (\phi_1+\phi_2)^2 = (1/\sqrt{4}-1\sqrt{4})^2 =0$

> The probability of finding with two waves is less than with a single wave!

Quantum probability do not depend the addition rule! This is because of the existence of the probability amplitude and because of possible interference when adding those amplitudes!.
