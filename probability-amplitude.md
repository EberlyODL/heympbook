The wave that is "linked" to the photon is the electromagnetic wave which is a fairly complicated object with oscillating electric and magnetic fields. A full analysis is very technical. We can understand the concepts of quantum mechanics by using a simplify picture for the wave. 

Denote the photon wave by $\phi(x)$ where $\phi$ represents the amplitude of the wave and x is the position on the screen. The amplitude of the wave will vary for different position so we say $\phi$ is a function of $x$ or $\phi(x)$. Let us imagine that the wave oscillates between 1 and -1. 

> a wave oscillates in space (with a certain wavelength) and it oscillates also in time (with a certain frequency). In practice, the oscillation in time are so fast that we always detect average quantity. Therefore, we will only keep track of variation in space. 

Given our discussion from the last section, the probability of finding a photon at position x will be 

$P(x) = \phi(x)^2$. 

Because we need to square, we say that $\phi$ is the **probability amplitude **. This is a strange object, the square root of probability!

> Probabilities are just numbers with no units. The probability that a coin lands on tails is 1/2. No units needed. The **probability amplitude** that a coin land on tails is $1/\sqrt{2}$. This is also just a number with no units and once you square it, it gives the probability of 1/2.

Here we have two waves (see fig below again). Note that the images show the intensity not the wave and more intense is more dark.

So let us denote the wave from slit 1 $\phi_1$ and the wave from slit 2 $\phi_2$. 

If only slit 1 is opened we get the pattern on uppermost left image. The prob
