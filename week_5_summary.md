- You should know some basic facts about the neutrino and about the Opera experiments.
- Special relativity is like good old relativity but extended to all laws of physics not just mechanics.
- From that principle and the theory of electricity, it follows that the speed of light is always the same for any moving observers.
- Einstein worked consequences of this fact and they are very strange (but true!)
  - Time dilation: Time runs more slowly when you go fast (in order to measure the same speed of light)
  - Mass and energy are one and the same.
- The formula for energy is $E^2 = m^2 c^4 + p^2 c^2$. If you have no momentum (i.e., if you are not moving and $p=0$) then this is just the famous formula $E = mc^2$.
- c is the symbol for the speed of light in vacuum. $$
