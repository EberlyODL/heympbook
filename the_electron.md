All the forces we have just discussed in examples are contact forces. The underlying cause and fundamental interaction behind contact forces is the electric force which we now turn to. 

Electricity is almost always caused by the movement of a single particle: the electron.

## The Electron

[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=800|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image]

As far as we know the electron has no substructure (it is not made of anything else). It is a fundamental particle of Nature and it has the following properties:

1. It has a mass of $m_e= 9.1 \times 10^{-31}$ kg
2. It has an electric charge of -1

## Electric Charge

The electromagnetic force acts on every particle that is charged. As we saw in week #1, the electron has one unit of negative electric charge. The proton has one unit of positive electric charge and the neutron is neutral and has zero electric charge. This means that the neutron does not feel the electric force while the electron and the proton do.

Experiments show that all charges that we see comes in integer units of an **elementary charge**  _e_.

$ e = 1.602\times10^{-19}$ Coulombs

where Coulombs is the unit for charge (name after a physicist called Coulomb). So the electron really has a charge of -_e_ while the proton is +_e_ but we often just say -1 and +1 where the 1 means 1 unit of the elementary charge e.
