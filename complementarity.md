Ok to summarise. 

Light is a wave but we "detect" the wave as a collection of photons. A wave of frequency f is made of photons with energy $E=hf$. The amplitude of the wave gives the probability amplitude of finding a photon at point in space x. To get the probability you square the probability amplitude. 

> When multiple waves arrive on the same spot, the principle of superposition of wave says to add the amplitude of each wave. This may result in surprising cancellations and enhancements in the probability of finding photons at some locations versus others.
