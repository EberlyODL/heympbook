Ok to summarise. 

Light is a wave but we "detect" the wave as a collection of photons. A wave of frequency f is made of photons with energy $E=hf$. The amplitude of the wave gives the probability amplitude of finding a photon at point in space x. To get the probability you square the probability amplitude. 

> When multiple waves arrive on the same spot, the principle of superposition of wave says to add the amplitude of each wave. This may result in surprising cancellations and enhancements in the probability of finding photons at some locations versus others. 

This interference will occur even when we send a single photon thru the double slit. In some sense, the photon interfere with itself. 

## Complementary

This is already strange but now comes the real weird stuff. 

Suppose we modify the double slit experiment so that we can tell which slits the photon went thru. We can for example put a photon detector that clicks when a photon pass by but does not absorb it so that the photon can keep going. 

We can do this experiment and what we find is that if we know that the photon went tru slit 1 we see the probability amplitude is $\phi_1$ with no interference. If we detect that it went thru slit 2, then we will see the $\phi_2$ pattern. 

There is two ways to describe this

1. The two measurements are complementary. There is no physical way to detect which slits the photons went thru and detect the interference pattern **at the same time**. 

2. The act of measuring changes the "state" of the system. Once we know that the photon went thru slit 1, we know we should use $\phi_1$ to predict the probability on the screen. (not $\phi_1+\phi_2$. 

You have to be careful with the second interpretation. Many physicists themselves misunderstand it and think that the act of measuring actually change the waves. It does not really change, it changed the information that we have. If we know that the photon went thru slit 1, it will affect all further probability and destroy the interference pattern. 

In the modern way of doing quantum mechanics, we often talk about information. Extracting information (not matter how) will affect all future probabilities. In some ways:

Here is a nice video that shows all the different aspects we have discussed about the double slit experiment.
