## Learning Objectives

The objectives for this lesson are that by the end of the week you will be able to:

1. Appreciate that electrons are also wave-particles.
2. Find the de Broglie wavelength of an electron.
3. Understand the uncertainty principle.
4. Recall what antimatter is.

<a href="https://www.nature.com/news/physicists-excited-by-latest-lhc-anomaly-1.21865" target="_blank">Hint of new particles?</a>

I choose this article. Very often the media jumps quickly on "hints" of new physics. Way too quickly in my opinion. Almost always, these hints turn out to be nothing. I am betting this particular discrepancy is probably just a fluke and I will wait until more data is collected and analyzed before getting excited.
