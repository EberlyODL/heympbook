The double slit experiment is a complicated system to study quantum mechanics. In the double slit, we have to discuss the probability amplitude for all values of position on the screen. There is really an infinite number of spots where the photons. The simplest quantum mechanics system has only 2 possible positions. This is what we called the Qbit. 

## Bits

A classical bit is a system that can be in two possible states. We call the first state 0 and the second 1. 

A bit can transmit information. For example in a time of war, a messenger would transmit this information

No message: No attack 
0: The attackers are coming by sea
1: The attackers are coming by land. 

We can share more complex message (and more information) using a series of bits. A message would look like 010100111000

> As we will see, bits are the basis for computing and the machine that actually stores the 0's and 1's is the transistor. Interestingly, quantum mechanics is needed for the transistor to be possible although the bits stored are classical objects. 

A quantum bit (or Qbit) is quantum system that also has two states, 0 or 1 when you measured it. The new thing with the Qbit is that while there is only two outcome to a measurement, the system can be in a superposition of the state 0 and 1. 

This is the basis for why quantum computers may be much more powerful than classical computers. 

Quantum computers will soon be
