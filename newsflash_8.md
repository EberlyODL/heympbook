## Newsflash: [First ever photograph inside a hydrogen atom] (https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-first-image-ever-of-a-hydrogen-atoms-orbital-struc-509684901) - this is an amazing article showing how we can see the wave nature of electrons while they are on an atom and occupying their orbitals.


Here is a brief background on orbitals from [Khan academy] (https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/chemistry--of-life/electron-shells-and-orbitals/v/orbitals) - This is NOT a required part of this course but it ties together the first half of this week nicely with the News-flash and any chemistry you might have had.


## Discovery of new particles - the Higgs Boson

As you probably have heard, the LHC was turned on a few years ago (and despite concerns, the world did not end), producing invaluable data for quite a while now, and the Higgs boson was discovered as expected! (maybe unexpected ones are to come?).

I recommend this short video by Brian Greene on the Higgs field and the Higgs particle.

Maybe the collider will detect new physics. One always has to be careful in science and discoveries take a while.


## Extra resources:
Before they turned the LHC on in 2008, some were concerned about it destroying the world. This produced <a href="http://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/">memes </a> in the science community, but was indeed a big deal. If you are interested here's a link to read: <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/will-the-lhc-destroy-the-earth-2015-4" target="_blank"> Will the LHC destroy the earth? </a>. Thankfully, the scientists were right.
