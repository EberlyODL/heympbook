New physics at the LHC. 

The LHC has been running for a few year now. It has discovered the Higgs boson but this was expected to be there. Maybe the collider will detect new physics. One has to be careful in science and discoveries take a while. 

## Hints of new physics 

The key word is hints!

<a href="https://www.nature.com/news/physicists-excited-by-latest-lhc-anomaly-1.21865" target="_blank">Hint of new particles?</a>

I choose this article because the media often jumps quickly on "hints" of new physics. Way too quickly in my opinion. Almost always, these hints turn out to be nothing. I am betting this particular discrepancy is probably just a fluke and I will wait until more data is collected and analyzed before getting excited.

## The discovery of the Higgs particle. 

As you probably have heard, the LHC was turned on, producing invaluable data for quite a while now, and the Higgs boson was discovered as expected! (maybe unexpected ones are to come?).

I recommend this short video by Brian Greene on the Higgs field and the Higgs particle.
