# # The discovery of the Higgs particle. 
As you probably have heard, the LHC was turned on a few years ago (and despite concerns, the world did not end), producing invaluable data for quite a while now, and the Higgs boson was discovered as expected! (maybe unexpected ones are to come?).
I recommend this short video by Brian Greene on the Higgs field and the Higgs particle.

Maybe the collider will detect new physics. One always has to be careful in science and discoveries take a while.
## Newsflash: Hints of new physics
The key word is hints!

I choose this article because the media often jumps quickly on "hints" of new physics. Way too quickly in my opinion. Almost always, these hints turn out to be nothing. I am betting this particular discrepancy is probably just a fluke and I will wait until more data is collected and analyzed before getting excited.

## Extra resources:
Before they turned the LHC on in 2008, some were concerned about it destroying the world. This produced <a href="http://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/">memes </a> in the science community, but was indeed a big deal. If you are interested here's a link to read: <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/will-the-lhc-destroy-the-earth-2015-4" target="_blank"> Will the LHC destroy the earth? </a>. Thankfully, the scientists were right.
