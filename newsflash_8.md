New physics at the LHC. 

The LHC has been running for a few year now. It has discovered the Higgs boson but this was expected to be there. Maybe the collider will detect new physics. One has to be careful in science and discoveries take a while. 

## Hints of new physics 

The key word is hints!


## The discovery of the Higgs particle. 

As you probably have heard, the LHC was turned on, producing invaluable data for quite a while now, and the Higgs boson was discovered as expected! (maybe unexpected ones are to come?).

I recommend this short video by Brian Greene on the Higgs field and the Higgs particle.
