## Newsflash: [First ever photograph inside a hydrogen atom](https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-first-image-ever-of-a-hydrogen-atoms-orbital-struc-509684901) - this is an amazing article showing how we can see the wave nature of electrons while they are on an atom and occupying their orbitals.


Here is a brief background on orbitals from [Khan academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/chemistry--of-life/electron-shells-and-orbitals/v/orbitals) - This is NOT a required part of this course but it ties together the first half of this week nicely with the News-flash and any chemistry you might have had.
