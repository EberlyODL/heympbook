[Hint of new particles from the LHC? ](https://www.nature.com/news/physicists-excited-by-latest-lhc-anomaly-1.21865)
I choose this article because the media often jumps quickly on "hints" of new physics. Way too quickly in my opinion. Almost always, these hints turn out to be nothing. I am betting this particular discrepancy is probably just a fluke and I will wait until more data is collected and analyzed before getting excited.
