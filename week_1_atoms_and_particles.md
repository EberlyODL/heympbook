In the weekly lessons, you will often see many discussions between Sophie and Marie. Sophie is a virtual student at Penn State and just like you she is super interested in learning physics and she is full of questions. Marie is a successful (but still virtual :) graduate student in physics who will try to answer all of Sophie's questions.

- Sophie: Hi there everybody! As this class is online you cannot ask questions in the lecture. But I am a virtual person...
- Marie: Just like me.
- S: So I can interrupt and ask questions.
- M: actually I have a question.
- S: But wait, you are the know-it all instructor! I am the one who ask the questions.
- M: Normally yes, but let me start with the first question.
- S: I have feeling I will not know the answer.
- M: So you said we are virtual people. That must mean we exist as bytes of 0 and 1 on a computer.
- S: I am already lost...
- M: Here is my question, could we have a soul or are we just machines?
- S: ...I thought this was a class about science not a philosophy class about souls.
- M: Yeah I know.... but just wondering...


Lesson Objectives
-----------------

By the end of the week you will be able to

1. Calculate with large and small numbers using the scientific notation.
2. Recall how the meter is defined by using the universality of the speed of light.
3. Recall the three basic constituents of atoms (electrons, protons and neutrons).
4. Distinguish atoms by their number of electrons, protons and neutrons.
5. Compare and contrast different atoms by their constituents in the periodic table of elements.
6. Discuss how we can move atoms one by one.

Readings
--------

- This lesson.
- Syllabus
- Get ahead for next week! Read Chapter 1 from the book:
  - pp.1-7 (beginning till "The surprisingly low energy in batteries")
  - pp 16-22, (from "Forms of Energy" to "Lightbulbs"
  - pp. 30-32 (from the "demise of the dinosaurs" till the end.

All chapter and page references are from your textbook "Physics and Technology for Future Presidents". You can do this reading during the weekend as it is in preparation for week 2.
