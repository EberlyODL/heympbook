##Newsflash:
I had to chose this article to talk about Neutrinos during our week about forces. Why? Because Neutrino's seemingly don't feel any forces! This makes them very hard to see and detect. Read this article to learn more. [What are Neutrinos and Why do they matter](https://www.space.com/41142-what-are-neutrinos-why-they-matter.html)


## Summary:
The four fundamental forces of Nature are:

1. Gravity
2. Weak
3. Strong
4. Electromagnetic

Newton's laws in terms of momentum:

1. **If there is no force acting on particle/wave, the momentum remains the same**.
2. **If a force acts on a particle it changes its momentum**.
3. **Momentum is conserved.**

A constant force F applied over an interval of time <lrn-math>(\Delta t)</lrn-math> changes the momentum by the amount   
  <lrn-math>F\Delta t = \Delta p</lrn-math>
