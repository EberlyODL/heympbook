The four fundamental forces of Nature are:

1. Gravity
2. Weak
3. Strong
4. Electromagnetic

Newton's laws in terms of momentum:

1. **If there is no force acting on particle/wave, the momentum remains the same**.
2. **If a force acts on a particle it changes its momentum**.
3. **Momentum is conserved.**

A constant force F applied over an interval of time \(\Delta t\) changes the momentum by the amount   
  $F\Delta t = \Delta p$
  
Electricity is one of the most common force of Nature and the underlying cause of all contact forces we feel and exerts.

- Electricity is an interaction between charged objects. The electron has negative charge -e and the proton has positive charge +e. Where $e = 1.602\times10^{-19}$ Coulombs.
- Most of the time, the electrons are the particles moving in an electric current. The eV is a unit for energy, which is just the charge e times 1 volt. 1 eV = $1.602 \times 10^{-19}$ Joules.
- Each charged object generates an electric field everywhere in space.
- Given a picture of the electric field. You should be able to determine where the force is stronger and in which direction it is. The magnitude of the electric force is the charge times the magnitude of the electric field $F = q E$. If the charge is negative, the force will be in the opposite direction as the E field.
- You should know what a conductor, a capacitor, and a battery are. Understand the water tower analogy.
