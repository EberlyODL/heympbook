- Oscillations are defined by two main quantities: the amplitude and the frequency. The amplitude is the measure of how large the displacement (of any kind) is from equilibrium while the frequency is the number of cycles per second. The unit of frequency is 1/s or Hz. We often also use the period \(T = 1/f\).
- A wave is an oscillation that also travels in space. It has all the property of an oscillation but it also has a wavelength \(\lambda\).
- You should be able to read from x (or y) versus t graph and y versus x graph all the data about a wave.
- \(v=\lambda f\) is an important equation and v does not change (\(\lambda\)) and (f) adjust themselves.
- waves bend on the slow side
- a minimum in speed leads to a channel where waves can be trapped.
- This trapping of waves lead to sound channels and the flying saucer in Roswell was probably a secret flying microphone disk.

- Waves can cancel and reinforce. (This is called interference.)
- When two waves with different shapes meet, you can just add the shapes directly on top of each other.
- You should be able to recognize the interference pattern of a single slit and a double slit and explain the physics behind those images.
- When a wave is confined or constrained, only a discrete set of vibration modes are allowed. These are called standing waves. For the case of a string of length L pinned at both ends, or a tube, the wavelengths are:

\(\lambda_n = \frac{2L}{n}\)

for n = 1, 2, 3, . . . where n is the harmonic number.
