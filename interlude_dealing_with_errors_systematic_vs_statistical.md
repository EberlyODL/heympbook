## Errors in Measurements

As we saw before, physics is an experimental science and every inquiry into Nature starts by making observation and taking measurements. Let us do a simple experiment. Pick up a pendulum in your house. Any object of some length with a mass at the tip will do. (I like to use my grandfather's watch as you can see on the side.) The pendulum oscillates because of the force of gravity. The period is just a function of the length of the pendulum and of a constant of nature $g$ which is called the gravitational acceleration. Never mind what that is but let us imagine that you have your own hypothesis for what gravity is and given the length of the pendulum and the period (how long for a back and forth) you are able to calculate $g$.

You want to check whether your prediction agrees with experiments.

To make sure you are doing things right, you take multiple measurements. I did it at home and here are my results for my own grandfather watch whose length I measured to be 20 cm.

|Period (s)|Length(m)| Gravitational constant "g" ($m/s^2$)
|--------
|0.95|2|9.75
|1.05|0.2|7.16
|0.75|0.2|14.03
|0.8|0.2|12.33

- S: Your measurements of the period are all over the place. They vary a lot.
- M: Yes right.

Random Statistical Errors
-------------------------

You have just seen the most typical type of error: the statistical error. As its name implies, it is due to the random fluctuations in the measurements. It's source is often easily identifiable and experimentalists work very hard to reduce this ever-present source of uncertainty.

## Sample Size

The most important thing about statistical random errors is that they are random. So once you have tried everything you can to minimize them, you can still reduce their effects by making many, many measurements. Sometimes you will measure a bigger value, sometimes a smaller value; by taking the average, you reduce the error.

Sample size is really important in science and many studies should not be trusted because of a small sample and uncontrolled random errors. If you ask ten of your friends about what their favorite color is, and you find a big preference for blue. You cannot conclude that this is true for the whole population, your sample size is too small.

## Systematic Errors

The most dangerous source of error is the non-random one. These systematic (one way or the other) errors cannot be eliminated by taking many many measurements. They don't average out. If you don't know what they are, it is very hard to eliminate them or even quantify their size. Here is an example.

In the measurement of the pendulum above, I never specified how exactly I measured the length. From the tip to the top of the watch or to the middle of the watch? The formula for the period is correct if I measure the length to the center of mass of the watch roughly in the middle, but if somebody had used the top (where the string attaches), they would have made a **_systematic error_**. All of their measurements would have been wrong (by a little bit).
