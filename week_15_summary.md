## Expansion and the Big-Bang.

The Universe is evolving in time. Star first formed, we grow old and galaxies and stars grow old.

In addition to this time evolution we found at the end of week 14 that the Universe is expanding. This is in and of itself a pretty provoking idea so let us look a bit more into what it means.

First this is a space expansion but you cannot feel it.

The fact that space can expand is a natural consequence of Einstein's theory of General Relativity. It is a "natural consequence" when spacetime becomes dynamical but it is pretty strange and Einstein refused to believe it at first. The problem is that if you run the clock backward in an expanding Universe, you find that in the past everything had to be closer together. There must be a point where everything we see was on top of each other. This is referred to as the Big Bang and given the measured rate of expansion, we believe that this singular Big Bang happened about 13.6 billions years ago.

This is all fine except that we don't know what "banged" in the Big Bang. It is also a point where Einstein's theory fail to make good predictions. The theory is singular because the energy density becomes extremely large. There must be another theory that takes over at this point. Speculative theories like string theory may do the job but it is too early to tell.
