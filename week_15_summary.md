### One final summary of big topics covered this week:
- We do not know whether the Universe is finite or infinite, but we know that it is evolving. We can only see the light of the stars that are close enough for their light to have had time to reach us. This resolves Olbers' paradox and explains why the sky is dark. Their used to be a time in the Universe where there were no stars.
- Any matter that is neutral under the electromagnetic force is "dark." So neutrons and neutrinos would be dark-matter candidates. We have evidence of another dark matter (beyond neutrons and neutrinos) in the Universe. It's exact nature as a particle (or something else) is unknown.
- Indirect evidence for dark matter comes from its gravitational effect on the rotation curve of stars in galaxy, and from the behavior of galaxies in galaxy clusters.
- Gravitational lensing refers to the bending of light around massive objects. By looking at distorted images we can figure where and how much mass there is in a galaxy cluster.
- When applied to the bullet cluster, gravitational lensing shows that the dark matter is clearly separated from the luminous matter (gases and galaxies).
- Einsteinâ€™s theory predicts that energy density should drive spacetime to expand or contract.
-Before 1998, most cosmologists thought that the Universe was dominated by dark matter which would slow down the expansion of space and possibly result in a future Big Crunch. Surprisingly enough, we found out that the Universe is accelerating. The Universe is getting bigger faster and faster and it shows no sign of ever wanting to stop and reverse.
- To explain this accelerating expansion, physicist invokes a new source of energy, called dark energy. This energy does not dilute as space expand. The prime candidate is that this dark energy is the energy of vacuum. It is still much of a mystery why the vacuum would have this amount of energy.
matter, and ~5% ordinary matter.
We hope one day to understand what that dark 95% really is.

### Final thoughts: The future of physics. Expansion and the Big-Bang.

The Universe is evolving in time. Star first formed, we grow old and galaxies and stars grow old.

In addition to this time evolution we found at the end of week 14 that the Universe is expanding. This is in and of itself a pretty provoking idea so let us look a bit more into what it means.

First this is a space expansion but you cannot feel it.

The fact that space can expand is a natural consequence of Einstein's theory of General Relativity. It is a "natural consequence" when spacetime becomes dynamical but it is pretty strange and Einstein refused to believe it at first. The problem is that if you run the clock backward in an expanding Universe, you find that in the past everything had to be closer together. There must be a point where everything we see was on top of each other. This is referred to as the Big Bang and given the measured rate of expansion, we believe that this singular Big Bang happened about 13.6 billions years ago.

This is all fine except that we don't know what "banged" in the Big Bang. It is also a point where Einstein's theory fail to make good predictions. The theory is singular because the energy density becomes extremely large. There must be another theory that takes over at this point. Speculative theories like string theory may do the job but it is too early to tell.
