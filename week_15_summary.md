### One final summary of big topics covered this week:

Summary from Galileo to Galaxies:
- Free fall times are the same for different mass objects if drag can be neglected.
  - This is because mass also causes inertia and appears in the definition of momentum. So even though a more massive object feels a bigger gravitational force, it is also harder to make it move.
- Newton's law of gravitation states that there is a universal attraction between every object with a mass. This force is proportional to the mass of each object and inversely proportional to the distance squared.
  - Near the surface of the Earth, the force of gravity is just <lrn-math>F = mg</lrn-math> with <lrn-math>g = 9.8 \; m/s^2</lrn-math>. This is called weight. It should not be confused with mass. Weight is a force and the unit is Newton or pounds. Mass is in kg.
- Einstein's theory of General Relativity eventually supplanted Newton's theory. The difference between the two theories is very small in our daily life but Einstein's theory does predict a few qualitatively new phenomena 
  - It predicts that light should also be affected by gravity. This has been verified experimentally.
  - It predicts the existence of black holes. We now have pretty good evidence that there is a black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
  - It predicts gravitational waves: ripples in spacetime. These have been found experimentally using LIGO.
- Orbits can be explained with Newton's theory. The velocity to stay in orbit is

<lrn-math>v^2 = \frac{GM}{r}</lrn-math>

- where <lrn-math>G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11}\; N\;m^2/kg^2</lrn-math> is Newton's constant. M is the mass of the planet you are orbiting around and r is the distance between the satellite/moon and the center of that planet.

- Our Universe contains: solar systems, galaxies and galaxy clusters.
- Doppler effect is the fact that the wavelength of a wave is shortened when a source is moving toward you while it is elongated when it is moving away.
  - We observe that almost all galaxies in the Universe are moving away from us (universe is expanding) because we see redshift (Doppler shift) in their spectral lines.


- We do not know whether the Universe is finite or infinite, but we know that it is evolving. We can only see the light of the stars that are close enough for their light to have had time to reach us. This resolves Olbers' paradox and explains why the sky is dark. Their used to be a time in the Universe where there were no stars.
- Any matter that is neutral under the electromagnetic force is "dark." We have evidence of another dark matter (beyond neutrons and neutrinos) in the Universe- but what it is is unknown.
- Indirect evidence for dark matter comes from its gravitational effect on the rotation curve of stars in galaxy, and from the behavior of galaxies in galaxy clusters.
- Gravitational lensing is the bending of light around massive objects. By looking at distorted images we can figure where and how much mass there is in a galaxy cluster.
- When applied to the bullet cluster, gravitational lensing shows that the dark matter is clearly separated from the luminous matter (gases and galaxies).
- Einsteinâ€™s theory predicts that energy density should drive spacetime to expand or contract.
-Before 1998, most cosmologists thought that the Universe was dominated by dark matter which would slow down the expansion of space and possibly result in a future Big Crunch. But, we found the Universe is accelerating its expansion, and it shows no sign of ever wanting to stop and reverse.
- To explain this accelerating expansion, physicist invokes a new source of energy, called dark energy. This energy does not dilute as space expand. The prime candidate is that this dark energy is the energy of vacuum. It is still much of a mystery why the vacuum would have this amount of energy.

The universe is only ~5% ordinary matter. We hope one day to understand what that dark 95% really is.

### Final thoughts: The future of physics. Expansion and the Big-Bang.

The Universe is evolving in time. We grow old and galaxies and stars grow old too.

Lets end with one more look at the expansion of the Universe. This is in and of itself a pretty provoking idea so let us look a bit more into what it means.

First this is a space expansion but you cannot feel it:

The fact that space can expand is a natural consequence of Einstein's theory of General Relativity. It is a "natural consequence" of a dynamic, changing spacetime, but it is pretty strange and even Einstein refused to believe it at first. The problem is that if you run the clock backward in an expanding Universe, you find that in the past everything had to be closer together. There must be a point where everything we see now was on top of each other. This is referred to as the Big Bang and, given the measured rate of expansion, we believe that this singular Big Bang happened about 13.6 billions years ago.

This is all fine except that we don't actually know what "banged" in the Big Bang. It is also a point where Einstein's theory fails to make good predictions. The theory is singular because the energy density becomes extremely large. There must be another theory that takes over at this point. Speculative theories like string theory may do the job but it is too early to tell. So I leave you with open questions, as is appropriate in a science class.
