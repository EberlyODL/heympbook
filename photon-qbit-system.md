Lets be more concrete and look at a very specific example of a Qbit. 

Image that we have beam of photons where we can send one photon at a time on a straight line. This is possible to do using lasers. Lets say that there is upper path for the photons and a lower path for the photons. There are two detectors $D_0$ and $D_1$ that can tell us whether the photon was in the upper beam or lower beam. If the photon is in the upper beam we will call that 0 and if it is in the lower beam we call it 1. 

In quantum mechanics, we will be able to take superposition so it is useful a notation to distinguish to the two states better. A notation was invited by Paul Dirac and it is called the ket. 

$\lvert 0\rangle$ is a upper beam photon and 
$\lvert 1\rangle$ is a lower beam photon
