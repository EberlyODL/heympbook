Evidence for dark matter has been pretty indirect up to now. Mostly we looked at the orbital motion of stars in galaxies or galaxies in galaxy clusters and found that their motion can only be explained if there is a new type of matter in the Universe.

Can we do better? Yes we can. With Einstein's theory, the curvature of spacetime affects light rays; see Fig. "Gravitational Lensing".

By looking at how images get distorted we can figure where the matter is; see Fig. "Massive clusters cause lensing".

When we use gravitational lensing, we measure that the mass of Abell 370 is much bigger than what merely meets the eye! In fact about 85% of the mass of this galaxy cluster is in the form of invisible dark matter and only 15% is gas and galaxies!
