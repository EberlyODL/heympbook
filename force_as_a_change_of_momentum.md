Instead of talking about velocity and acceleration, we can reframe the whole discussion around momentum. This is in fact a better (and more correct) way to think about forces.

Remember that momentum is something that all particles and waves have. The low speed formula (low compare to the speed of light) for momentum is just:

<lrn-math>p = mv</lrn-math>

which is just mass times velocity.

Let us now rephrase the first two of Newton's laws in term of momentum.

1. **If there is no force acting on particle/wave, the momentum remains the same**. The particle keeps moving in the same direction with the same velocity and the same momentum. So in the absence of forces, the momentum does not change.
2. **If a force acts on a particle it changes its momentum**. A constant force F applied over an interval of time <lrn-math>\Delta t</lrn-math> changes the momentum by the amount

<lrn-math> F\Delta t = \Delta p</lrn-math>

This is the same as <lrn-math>F=ma</lrn-math> (we've just multiplied both sides of the equation by <lrn-math>\Delta t</lrn-math>)but we will use the former more in this class. The SI unit for force is called the Newton (N).

> Force, like momentum, has a sign. A force to left is negative and a force to the right is positive.

This is another part of the class where you are expected to be able to do some numerical computation. Look at the following example. We have a 1000 kg car initially moving at <lrn-math>20 m/s</lrn-math>. The driver breaks upon seeing an accident and successfully stop in 5 seconds (this is <lrn-math>\Delta t</lrn-math>, the interval of time). What was the force?

> We use the "i" subscript for initial and "f" subscript for final. The change in momentum is always "final" - "initial" so <lrn-math>\Delta p= p_f-p_i</lrn-math>. Be careful with signs! We could have a situation, for example, where both the initial momentum and final momentum are positive (to the right) but the change in momenta is negative (to the left). This would occur if the object is slowing down and the change in momentum being negative means the force is negative (to the left).

The relationship <lrn-math>F\Delta t = \Delta p</lrn-math> tell us something important about how we can make a force bigger or smaller by changing **the time interval** over which the force act. Look carefully at the next question.

**To summarize, in the absence of any forces, I keep moving with the same momentum. If someone exerts a force on me over a certain amount of time, then my momentum will change.**

But momentum is really conserved. Like energy, no momentum is ever created or destroyed in the Universe, it just moves around. It is not really a change in momentum. It is more of an **exchange** of momentum between two (or more) entities. And this observation is the basis for Newton's third law.
