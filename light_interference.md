In lab #1, you showed that the interference pattern from the double slit experiment is evidence of the notion that light must be a wave. The pattern of dark and bright spots that one gets after a light wave goes through a slit or two slits is impossible to explain if light is just made of particles.

Lets take a second look at interference.

## Interference take 2

If you have multiple waves in the same medium, recall that you can just superimpose them to get the resulting wave (we did this in in week 4). Try this.

Superposition and interference are really synonyms for us (superposition is more general).

Constructive interference occurs when the two waves are exactly in phase (left in figure "constructive and destructive interference") while destructive interference occurs when they are exactly out of phase (right on the same figure).

The destructive interference happens when one wave is shifted compared to other by an amount that is half a wavelength.

$\rm{shift} = \frac{\lambda}{2}$ leads to destructive interference.

Constructive interference is easier, the two waves are exactly in phase and it looks like there is no shift between the two. 

We go over this again now, because light and interference will come back again as we travel through the quantum world.
