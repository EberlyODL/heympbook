We saw that photons are described by a wave whose amplitude is the electric field, and it varies in space and in time $E(x,t)$. The square of the amplitude of the oscillating E-field is proportional to the intensity, but, more importantly, it gives you the **probability** function of where you have more or fewer chances to find the photon.

The same story repeats itself for the electron, or any other particles for that matter. In this case, the amplitude of the wave is called $\psi(x)$. We then have the probability of finding an electron in a given region of space $\delta x$ is

$\rm{Prob}(\rm{in}\;\delta x\; \rm{at}\; x) \propto \psi(x)^2$

The subject of quantum mechanics is partly about finding the wavefunction $\psi(x)$ for a given system. Once we know the wavefunction, we can tell the probability of finding the particle here or there. And this is not as hard as it sounds, since $\psi(x)$ is a wave like any other wave. In particular, it can have standing wave patterns.

## An Electron in a Box 

Imagine that one single electron is stuck in a box. Inside the box, there is no electric field and no electric potential energy, but on the edge of the box there is a strong force that blocks the electron's way, just like a wall. We can represent this with a potential energy graph like Fig. "Electron Box".

Since the edge of the box is a wall, the electron cannot be found there. Since the amplitude of the wave is the probability of finding the electron, we must have that the wave is zero on the wall. The wave is "pinned" just like a string can be attached at both ends. Just like the guitar string, only a special set of waves (or notes) is allowed as depicted. So using the de Broglie relationship and the allowed quantized wavelength standing waves, we find that the momentum of the electrons must be quantized.

$\lambda_n = \frac{2L}{n} = \frac{h}{p}$

where L is the size of the box and n is an integer (1,2,3...). We conclude that the momentum of an electron inside of a box is a multiple integer of a basic unit, let's call this basic unit $p_1$.

$p = n p_1$

Similarly, the only energy the electron has inside the box is kinetic energy $K=\frac12 mv^2 = \frac{p^2}{m}$ where I wrote the formula in terms of momentum. So the energy goes like momentum squared.

$E_n = n^2 E_1$

For some basic quantum of energy $E_1$ which depends on the size of the box, the mass of the particle, etc. Let's summarize what just happened, since this is important.

**By imposing that the wave of the electron vanishes at some places, we get standing wave patterns with different harmonic wavelengths. This implies that the momentum and energy of the electron are quantized. Not all values are possible but only integer (or integer squared) of a basic unit.**

Note that n=0 is NOT possible, since the electron would have zero energy and we know that it must at least have its mass energy. So the lowest energy an electron can have is $E_1$ for n=1, the first harmonic. Fig. "Energy in Box" shows the first four levels of energy for an electron in a box.

## Finding the Electron in the Box 

The different wavefunctions of the electrons contain a lot of information. By taking the square of the wave, i.e. by squaring the amplitude at each point, we get information as to where the electron will most probably be found or not.

Each standing wave has nodes where the amplitude is always zero. At those points, the electron will never be found. For example, an electron in the third state $E_3$ will never be in the walls but also at two spots in the middle (see Fig. "The First 3 States").
