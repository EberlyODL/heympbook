## Lesson Objectives

The objectives for this lesson are that by the end of the week you will be able to

* LOFor08: identify the important scaling relationships in Newton's law of gravity.
* LOFor09: note some differences between Newton's theory and Einstein's theory of General Relativity
* LOPW13: describe the Doppler effect.
* LOCos01: identify and name different orbits around the Earth
* LOCos02: list some of the indirect evidences we have for dark matter
* LOCos03: discuss dark energy, why we think it exists in the Universe and what it could be
