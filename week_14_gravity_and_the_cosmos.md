The objectives for this lesson are that by the end of the week you will be able to

* LOFor08: identify the important scaling relationships in Newton's law of gravity.
* LOFor09: note some differences between Newton's theory and Einstein's theory of General Relativity
* LOFor10: explain how gravity influences satellites, orbits, and weight
* LOPW13: describe the Doppler effect.
