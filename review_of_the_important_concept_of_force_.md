Quick Summary of forces up to now

- A force is defined as an **interaction** between two objects which result in an **exchange of momentum** from one object to the other.
- The (ex)change of momentum is equal to the force during the interaction multiplied by the time the force is acting. In a equation this is <lrn-math> F\Delta t = \Delta p</lrn-math>  (we will use this equation instead of the more famous <lrn-math>F=ma</lrn-math> but they are equivalent).
- One needs to be careful to use the correct sign for the change in momentum and for force. In this class, we will always look at one dimensional situation (just right and left). Right is positive while left is negative.
- Because this is an exchange in momentum, the momentum loss of the first object is exactly the same as the momentum gain of the other interacting object. Up to an important sign, this means that the force that object 1 exert on object 2 is equal in magnitude to the force of object 2 on object 1. The forces have the same magnitude but opposite direction.

### Multiple forces at once.

Imagine pushing a box on the floor at constant velocity. With what force are you pushing?

This is strange as the momentum of the box is not changing (the speed is constant). That would mean the force is zero but the man is pushing!

The key is that when there is more than one force, you need to sum all the forces to find the change momentum.

We will call the net or total force, the sum of all forces. <lrn-math>F_{total} = \sum F</lrn-math> where <lrn-math>\sum</lrn-math> is the mathematical symbol for sum.

Newton's law is really a statement about the total force.

<lrn-math>F_{total}\Delta t = \Delta p</lrn-math>.

when you push the box on the floor, you exert a push on the box <lrn-math>F_{push}</lrn-math> but the floor also exerts a force on the box because of friction <lrn-math>F_{friction}</lrn-math>. Since we are told the box is moving at constant velocity, we must have that the change of momentum is zero.

<lrn-math>\Delta p </lrn-math> =0

and therefore, the net or total force must be zero

<lrn-math>F_{total} = F_{push} +F_{friction} = 0</lrn-math>

That is the two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.
