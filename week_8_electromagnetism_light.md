## Lesson Objectives

The objectives for this lesson are that by the end of the week you will be able to

* LOFor05 relate a changing electric field to a magnetic field and vice-versa.
* LOTec03 summarize the physical concepts behind an electromagnet, a generator and a transformer.
* LOTec04 discuss why the electric grid uses AC current.
* LOPW08 describe light as an oscillating electric and magnetic field and list its properties.
*
LOPW09 employ the relation between intensity, power, and energy for a wave.
*
LOPW10 identify different types of electromagnetic waves
* LOPW11 describe radiative heat and the greenhouse effect.

## News Article
This week we actually have 2 news articles because Climate Change is an ever evolving research study and it is interesting to see how as time passes data changes and analysis also changes!

- the article above is from 2013, just 2 years later the tide changed again:
